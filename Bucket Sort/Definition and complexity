Bucket Sort

Bucket Sort isa sorting algorithm that divides the unsorted array elements into several groups called buckets. 
Each bucket is then sorted by using any of the suitablesorting algorithmsor recursively applying the same bucket algorithm.
Finally, the sorted buckets are combined to form a final sorted array.


Scatter Gather Approach 
The process of bucket sort can be understood as ascatter-gather approach. 
Here, elements are first scattered into buckets then the elements in each bucket are sorted. 
Finally, the elements are gathered in order.
