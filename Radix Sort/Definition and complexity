RADIX SORT

Radix sort is the linear sorting algorithm that is used for integers. 
In Radix sort, there is digit by digit sorting is performed that is started from the least significant digit to the most significant digit.

Radix sort is a sorting algorithm that sorts the elements by first grouping the individual digits of the same place value. 
Then, sort the elements according to their increasing/decreasing order.
Suppose, we have an array of 8 elements. 
First, we will sort elements based on the value of the unit place. 
Then, we will sort elements based on the value of the tenth place. 
This process goes on until the last significant place.
