SELECTION SORT
The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element 
(considering ascending order) from the unsorted part and putting it at the beginning.


Time Complexities:
Worst Case Complexity: O(n2) If we want to sort in ascending order and the array is in descending order then, the worst case occurs.

Best Case Complexity: O(n2) It occurs when the array is already sorted

Average Case Complexity: O(n2) It occurs when the elements of the array are in jumbled order (neither ascending nor descending).

Space complexity is O(1) because an extra variable temp is used.
