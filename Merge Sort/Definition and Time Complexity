MERGE SORT
Merge Sort is one of the most popularsorting algorithms that is based on the principle of Divide and Conquer Algorithm.
Here, a problem is divided into multiple sub-problems. 
Each sub-problem is solved individually. 
Finally, sub-problems are combined to form the final solution.



MergeSortAlgorithm
The MergeSortfunction repeatedly divides the array into two halves until we reach a stage where we try to perform MergeSorton a subarray of size 1 i.e. p == r.
After that, the merge function comes into play and combines the sorted arrays into larger arrays until the whole array is merged.


TIME COMPLEXITY

Best Case Complexity: O(n*log n)
Worst Case Complexity: O(n*log n)
Average Case Complexity: O(n*log n)

SPACE COMPLEXITY

The space complexity of merge sort is O(n).
